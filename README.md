P4 - Task Master

This application allows users to signup and login to a secure environment in which users can create task lists.

Task lists are dynamic in the sense that the user has full control over the number of task items, input for each item,
and position for each item.  The user has the ability to update and edit task text, color, and position.  All changes to
the task list are saved for future reference.

The key functions involved in this application are:

Create - add tasks
Edit
Delete
Serialize
Color

User Signup Validation
